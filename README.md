### **Step 2: Prepare for Cloning**

1. **Backup important data** just in case. Even though cloning is low-risk, it‚Äôs wise to be cautious.
2. Make sure the SSD is **unallocated** (i.e., no partitions on it). If it has any partitions, delete them using:

   * Disk Management (`Win+X ‚Üí Disk Management`) or
   * Macrium Reflect's partition tools.

### **Step 3: Start the Clone Process**

1. In Macrium Reflect:

   * Your current system disk (HDD) should show up at the top.
   * Click **‚ÄúClone this disk...‚Äù** under your current HDD.

2. In the wizard:

   * Select your **new SSD** as the **destination disk**.
   * Click **‚ÄúSelect a disk to clone to‚Ä¶‚Äù** and choose your SSD.

3. If the SSD is smaller than the HDD:

   * Manually drag the partitions one-by-one from the source to the destination and **resize** the main partition (usually C:) to fit.

4. Confirm the partition layout looks good.

### **Step 4: Begin Cloning**

1. Click **‚ÄúNext‚Äù** ‚Üí then **‚ÄúFinish‚Äù**.
2. You can uncheck the option to save the backup as an XML file.
3. Click **‚ÄúOK‚Äù** to start the clone.
4. Wait for the process to complete (can take 15 minutes to over an hour depending on disk size/speed).

---

### **Step 5: Boot from SSD**

1. Shut down the computer once cloning completes.
2. Disconnect the **old HDD** (physically unplug the SATA or power cable), or enter BIOS and set the **SSD as the first boot device**.
3. Boot into Windows ‚Äî it should look exactly the same but now running from the SSD.

---

### **Step 6: Verify & Cleanup**

1. Once verified everything works, you can:

   * Wipe the old HDD and use it for storage.
   * Or leave it disconnected if you plan to repurpose/dispose of it.

---

## üßº Optional Post-Clone Tweaks

* Enable **TRIM** support for SSDs (usually enabled by default on Windows 10).
* Run `Win + R ‚Üí dfrgui` and turn **off scheduled defragmentation** for the SSD.
* Consider running:

  ```powershell
  fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify
  ```

  Should return `0` (means TRIM is enabled).
